# Example SCAP Content
Some SCAP content that I've created with the intention of learning the SCAP XML.

Run the SCAP checks using:
```
oscap xccdf eval security-baseline.xml
```

* The content is based off a series of tutorials by Sven Vermeulen: http://blog.siphos.be/2013/12/running-a-bit-with-the-xccdf-document/.
* The remediation content was created using guidance from ZbynÄ›k Moravec: https://blog-zbynek.rhcloud.com/2016/09/12/ssg-openscap-and-ansible/
